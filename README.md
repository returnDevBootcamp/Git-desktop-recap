#### If you were chosen to be Mayor of hargeisa what would you change? 👀

#### Answer:well i would work mainly on two things, first build more water dams, because annually alot of rain water are gone waste rather than benefiting from it. And secondly, the roads whether is fixing them or building new ones or rearranging them, bc hargeisa have high population and the number of cars increased which coused more rush hours where there is more traffic jam hours than before.
